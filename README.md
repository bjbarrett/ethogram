# ETHOGRAM v1.0 


Thanks for trying out ETHOGRAM v1.0. Here are instructions to get it running on an android tablet.

1. Download the ETHOGRAM shell script ethogram.sh from GIT repository 

2. Plug your android device into your computer.

3. Drag the ETHOGRAM script into a designated folder— I typically just use the /sdcard folder but anything will work as long as you navigate to it properly from the terminal. You can also push it from the terminal manually if you are so inclined.

4. Open up your terminal emulator and navigate to the directory where you installed ETHOGRAM. If you installed it in the SD card folder, for example, type:

        cd /sdcard

5. You will now see the name of that folder in the root directory. Now that you have navigated there type in the terminal:

        sh ethogram.sh

6. This will execute the shell script. If you see “Howdy! Please enter a file name” it is working.

7. Enter a filename followed by the .csv extension. For example: NewDataJan2013.csv

8. Start Typing. Every time you press enter a timestamp will be recorded and the .csv file will be automatically updated.

9. To exit, type DONE when finished. 

10. You can access the file from either an internal file explorer on your device or by plugging in into your computer after restarting your tablet/phone.
